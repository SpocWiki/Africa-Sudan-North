> **Meroë** (also spelled Meroe; Meroitic: 𐦨𐦡𐦷𐦡𐦥𐦢, romanized: Medewi; Arabic: مرواه, romanized: Meruwah and مروي, Meruwi; Ancient Greek: Μερόη, romanized: Meróē) 
> was an ancient city on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km north-east of the Kabushiya station 
> near Shendi, Sudan, approximately 200 km north-east of Khartoum. 
> 
> Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah (Arabic: البجراوية). 
> This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC, 
> until its collapse in the 4th century AD. 
> 
> The Kushitic Kingdom of Meroë gave its name to the "Island of Meroë", 
> which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile 
> (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah and the Blue Nile.
>
> The city of Meroë was on the edge of Butana. 
> There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana: 
> Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. 
> 
> The first of these sites was given the name Meroë by the Persian king Cambyses, 
> in honor of his sister who was called by that name. 
> 
> The city had originally borne the ancient appellation Saba, 
> named after the country's original founder. 
> The eponym Saba, or Seba, is named for one of the sons of Cush (see Genesis 10:7). 
> 
> The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. 
> The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.
>
> The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Meroë 
> represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. 
> It was one of the earliest and most advanced states found on the African continent. 
> 
> Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, 
> one's understanding of Meroë in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.
>
> The site of the city of Meroë is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups, 
> of which many are in ruins. 
> 
> They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids.
